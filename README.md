# Choose-my-Starbucks-Order
## A Python Flask web-server project to get a random Starbucks drink name 
Difficult to decide what to order from Starbucks? No worries! The "Choose My Starbucks Order" online web-application is here!

This project is getting data from [Mock Starbucks API](https://github.com/nimelica/Mock-Starbucks-API) and gives you a random drink name every time to save you thinking about what to drink today!
